# Gesture Recognition Project

## Problem Statement
As a data scientist, At a home electronics company that manufactures state-of-the-art smart televisions, we want to develop a cool feature in the smart TV that can recognize five different gestures performed by the user. This feature will help users control the TV without using a remote.

## Conclusion
We selected **Model 12 (TimeDistributed Conv2D)** as our final model because it achieved a training accuracy of **0.93** and a validation accuracy of **0.91**, which met our requirements.
